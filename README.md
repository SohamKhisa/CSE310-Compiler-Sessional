This repository contains the codes for my undergraduate lab course <b>CSE310-Compiler Sessional</b> at <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/">BUET</a>.
This compiler can compile a subset of instructions of the <b>C programming language</b>. This includes arithmetic operations, array, function, loop (while and for), if-else statements, etc.
The steps of a compiler is shown in the image below.
